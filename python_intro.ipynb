Always think about clarity -> comment, comment, comment: if you win the lottery and move to Barbados tomorrow, someone else (or you in 3 years time once you've spent the money) needs to pick up your work.\n","2.   Start easy -> visualise your data, then think about most appropriate processing steps.\n","3.   Keep code flexible -> Use functions that perform standard tasks well, this will save you A LOT of time.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Zu5ddHA5lyYc"},"source":["## 1 - Functions\n","An admittedly unconventional intro to coding but functions are so key to software development that let's give you a clear understanding of what they do."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"3kh0jZw-g7zf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1636981732443,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":191,"user":{"displayName":"Luke Cullen","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"06644617814134552922"}},"outputId":"eb1c1e21-76da-4757-dfdc-5b27e52c9ace"},"source":["\"\"\"Example of a simple script\"\"\"\n","\n","# Input - Variable definition\n","qty_apples = 4\n","price_apple = 0.45\n","\n","# Processing - Total cost calculation\n","cost_total = qty_apples*price_apple#complete here\n","\n","# Output - Print to screen\n","print(cost_total)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1.8\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"094AMfEqijDW"},"source":["\"\"\"Definition of function\"\"\"\n","\n","def cost_calculation(qty,price):\n","  \"\"\"This function multiplies the quantity of items\n","  by the unit prices and prints total cost.\n","\n","  Inputs\n","  qty - item quantity\n","  price - unit price\n","\n","  Outputs\n","  Total cost print to screen\n","  \"\"\"\n","  # Calculation\n","  cost = qty*price\n","  # Output\n","  print(cost_total) "],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"X9G9BV8pkh6j","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1636981820709,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":190,"user":{"displayName":"Luke Cullen","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"06644617814134552922"}},"outputId":"2e40030d-706d-4b1b-afd7-f1ec1dfbd576"},"source":["\"\"\"Use function - type cost_calculation( and follow the instructions\"\"\"\n","cost_calculation(qty_apples,price_apple)#complete here"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["1.8\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xjd_WkuhwGMC"},"source":["Ok so that is a very basic function.
